In this half-day workshop: We look at how to implement secure coding practices, and then move on to discuss the ins and outs of modern continuous integration. After we lock down our CI pipelines, we’ll look at how to find vulnerabilities in our dependencies. Armed with that information we’ll learn how to properly triage threats, exploits, vulnerabilities that affect our software, and how to streamline code improvements. Before we’re done, we’ll investigate modern processes for continuous deployment, including secure infrastructure as code development and how to lock down our CD pipelines.
