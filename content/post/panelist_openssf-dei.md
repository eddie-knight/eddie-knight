Upcoming Panel!

DE&I is defined as diversity, equity and inclusion. This panel is aimed at a broad perspective on DE&I in cybersecurity today. Every member of the panel has had a meaningful impact on open source, and this discussion will cover how their unique experiences have informed a perspective on how to get involved in open source - but what it means to thrive in those spaces.
