Following the global wave of innovation on artificial intelligence, machine learning tools, and every possible variation of GPT driven chatbots... Ishmael has been propelled to Chief Technical Officer of Paragon Logic, the most ambitious technical organization of the 21st century.

But no one can anticipate the trouble that will come from the aspirations and momentum the company has gained on the international stage.
