Security Slam is a 30-day challenge designed to help creators and users of CNCF projects improve their software supply chain security at scale. Participants will have access to the Security Slam Library, which will include articles and videos created by Sonatype to help improve security posture. Success metrics and participation awards will be announced at the kickoff webinar, so be sure to sign up and join us for this exciting event!</description></item><item><title>Panelist: Creative, Inclusive, and Sustainable Cybersecurity</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/17/cncf-slam/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/17/cncf-slam/</guid><description>Upcoming Panel!
DE&amp;amp;I is defined as diversity, equity and inclusion. This panel is aimed at a broad perspective on DE&amp;amp;I in cybersecurity today. Every member of the panel has had a meaningful impact on open source, and this discussion will cover how their unique experiences have informed a perspective on how to get involved in open source - but what it means to thrive in those spaces.</description></item><item><title>Workshop: All your Security Shifted to the Left</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/16/kcdc-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/16/kcdc-workshop/</guid><description>Upcoming Workshop!
We’ll look at how to implement secure coding practices, and then move on to discuss the ins and outs of modern continuous integration. After we lock down our CI pipelines, we’ll look at how to find vulnerabilities in our dependencies. Armed with that information we’ll learn how to properly triage threats, exploits, vulnerabilities that affect our software, and how to streamline code improvements. Before we’re done, we’ll investigate modern processes for continuous deployment, including secure infrastructure as code development and how to lock down our CD pipelines.</description></item></channel></rss>
