I get it. On one hand, you know they&amp;rsquo;re important for keeping your applications and systems secure. On the other hand, they can be overwhelming, dry, and difficult to implement.
But what if I told you that security checklists don&amp;rsquo;t have to be that way?

As a software engineer, I personally get frustrated by those results almost instantly.

Instead, we’ll be taking a quick look at what an exploit against these two new issues could be able to do- and compare it to two other common dependency exploits.</description></item><item><title>Stop the Low-Quality Contribution Plague</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/10/20/contribution-plague/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/10/20/contribution-plague/</guid><description>I was in a discussion thread with folks from Cloud Native Computing Foundation and Kubernetes today, and this phrase came up again. The context was something along the lines of… “we’re afraid that will encourage low-quality contributions.”
Let’s dig in to this.</description></item><item><title>How to Become a New Open Source Contributor</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/09/22/oss-contributor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/09/22/oss-contributor/</guid><description>Becoming a new contributor to open source software is one of the biggest obstacles I watch people hit regularly.
I’ve seen a hundred false starts from recent grads and even people who have been working in tech for years. The obstacle is consistent, but the solution isn’t always simple.</description></item></channel></rss>
