It can get confusing, but it’s a lot easier when you can sort them into different methodologies. And the process becomes almost simple once we properly understand the different impacts that each methodology will have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pythonista’s Guide to the OWASP Top 10</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/14/python-owasp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/14/python-owasp/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re like many developers or IT professionals, you may have mixed feelings about these lists. I get it. On one hand, you know they&amp;rsquo;re important for keeping your applications and systems secure. On the other hand, they can be overwhelming, dry, and difficult to implement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what if I told you that security checklists don&amp;rsquo;t have to be that way? What if I showed you how to approach these lists in a whole new light, and make easy work of the items on them? That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what this article is all about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5 Tools to Automate SBOM Creation</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/13/sbom-creation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/13/sbom-creation/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you search for “How to Automate SBOM Creation” you’ll find a huge number of results. As a software engineer, I personally get frustrated by those results almost instantly. Instead of telling me how to automate the creation of my SBOM, most of them spend half the article telling me why I should automate my SBOM creation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to do this a bit differently by focusing just on tools you can actually use in your CI pipeline for free right now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What the OpenSSL Vulnerabilities Are…and Aren't</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/01/oss-contributor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/01/oss-contributor/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article, we won’t be going into detail about how the vulnerability came to be or even how to patch it (in short: upgrade to the latest). Instead, we’ll be taking a quick look at what an exploit against these two new issues could be able to do- and compare it to two other common dependency exploits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stop the Low-Quality Contribution Plague</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/10/20/contribution-plague/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/10/20/contribution-plague/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was in a discussion thread with folks from Cloud Native Computing Foundation and Kubernetes today, and this phrase came up again. The context was something along the lines of… “we’re afraid that will encourage low-quality contributions.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s dig in to this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Become a New Open Source Contributor</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/09/22/oss-contributor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/09/22/oss-contributor/</guid><description>&lt;p>Becoming a new contributor to open source software is one of the biggest obstacles I watch people hit regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve seen a hundred false starts from recent grads and even people who have been working in tech for years. The obstacle is consistent, but the solution isn’t always simple.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
