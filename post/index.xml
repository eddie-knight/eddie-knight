Success metrics and participation awards will be announced at the kickoff webinar, so be sure to sign up and join us for this exciting event!</description></item><item><title>Creative, Inclusive, and Sustainable Cybersecurity</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/17/openssf-panelist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/17/openssf-panelist/</guid><description>Panelist at the upcoming OpenSSF Day during Open Source Summit North America.
DE&amp;amp;I is defined as diversity, equity and inclusion. This panel is aimed at a broad perspective on DE&amp;amp;I in cybersecurity today. Every member of the panel has had a meaningful impact on open source, and this discussion will cover how their unique experiences have informed a perspective on how to get involved in open source - but what it means to thrive in those spaces.</description></item><item><title>All your Security Shifted to the Left</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/16/kcdc-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/16/kcdc-workshop/</guid><description>Teacher for this upcoming workshop.
We’ll look at how to implement secure coding practices, and then move on to discuss the ins and outs of modern continuous integration. After we lock down our CI pipelines, we’ll look at how to find vulnerabilities in our dependencies. Armed with that information we’ll learn how to properly triage threats, exploits, vulnerabilities that affect our software, and how to streamline code improvements. Before we’re done, we’ll investigate modern processes for continuous deployment, including secure infrastructure as code development and how to lock down our CD pipelines.</description></item><item><title>Pythonista’s Guide to the OWASP Top 10</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/14/python-owasp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/14/python-owasp/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like many developers or IT professionals, you may have mixed feelings about these lists. I get it. On one hand, you know they&amp;rsquo;re important for keeping your applications and systems secure. On the other hand, they can be overwhelming, dry, and difficult to implement.
But what if I told you that security checklists don&amp;rsquo;t have to be that way? What if I showed you how to approach these lists in a whole new light, and make easy work of the items on them?</description></item><item><title>Conference Speaker: Devnexus 2023</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/06/devnexus-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/06/devnexus-2023/</guid><description>Atlanta, GA hosted 2023&amp;rsquo;s largest Java Conference in the United States.</description></item><item><title>5 Tools to Automate SBOM Creation</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/13/sbom-creation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/13/sbom-creation/</guid><description>If you search for “How to Automate SBOM Creation” you’ll find a huge number of results. As a software engineer, I personally get frustrated by those results almost instantly. Instead of telling me how to automate the creation of my SBOM, most of them spend half the article telling me why I should automate my SBOM creation.
I want to do this a bit differently by focusing just on tools you can actually use in your CI pipeline for free right now.</description></item><item><title>Open Source in Finance 101</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/08/os-in-finance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/08/os-in-finance/</guid><description>Grizz from FINOS interviews Eddie Knight and Colin Griffin on the fundamentals of Open Source in the Financial Services sector.</description></item><item><title>Interviewing Jon Gottfried &amp; Fiona Whittington</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/12/12/zbg-henry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/12/12/zbg-henry/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing Andres Vega</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/12/05/zbg-henry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/12/05/zbg-henry/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing Taylor Dolezal</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/28/zbg-henry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/28/zbg-henry/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing Vincent Danen</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/21/zbg-henry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/21/zbg-henry/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing Henry Quaye</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/14/zbg-henry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/14/zbg-henry/</guid><description/></item><item><title>What the OpenSSL Vulnerabilities Are…and Aren't</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/01/oss-contributor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/01/oss-contributor/</guid><description>In this article, we won’t be going into detail about how the vulnerability came to be or even how to patch it (in short: upgrade to the latest). Instead, we’ll be taking a quick look at what an exploit against these two new issues could be able to do- and compare it to two other common dependency exploits.

The context was something along the lines of… “we’re afraid that will encourage low-quality contributions.”
Let’s dig in to this.

I’ve seen a hundred false starts from recent grads and even people who have been working in tech for years. The obstacle is consistent, but the solution isn’t always simple.
