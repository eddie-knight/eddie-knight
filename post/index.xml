After we lock down our CI pipelines, we’ll look at how to find vulnerabilities in our dependencies. Armed with that information we’ll learn how to properly triage threats, exploits, vulnerabilities that affect our software, and how to streamline code improvements. Before we’re done, we’ll investigate modern processes for continuous deployment, including secure infrastructure as code development and how to lock down our CD pipelines.</description></item><item><title>Creative, Inclusive, and Sustainable Cybersecurity</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/05/10/openssf-panelist/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/05/10/openssf-panelist/</guid><description>Panelist at OpenSSF Day during Open Source Summit North America.</description></item><item><title>How I Got Involved with the OpenSSF</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/05/04/openssf-involvement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/05/04/openssf-involvement/</guid><description>Let’s get it out of the way early: it’s not always clear how you can best plug into organizations like OpenSSF. That’s why I’m writing this guest blog post as an “outsider.” I’m just your average tech employee who has become progressively more involved since my company, Sonatype, became members of OpenSSF.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Security Testing on an Organization</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/24/security-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/24/security-testing/</guid><description>Choosing the right security testing tools is hard, because each type of tool has a different purpose with unique strengths. It can get confusing, but it’s a lot easier when you can sort them into different methodologies. And the process becomes almost simple once we properly understand the different impacts that each methodology will have.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Security Slam</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/18/cncf-slam/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/18/cncf-slam/</guid><description>Organizer and host of this annual event. The topic was recently announced for 2023.
Security Slam is a 30-day challenge designed to help creators and users of CNCF projects improve their software supply chain security at scale. Participants will have access to the Security Slam Library, which will include articles and videos created by Sonatype to help improve security posture. Success metrics and participation awards will be announced at the kickoff webinar, so be sure to sign up and join us for this exciting event!</description></item><item><title>Pythonista’s Guide to the OWASP Top 10</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/14/python-owasp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/14/python-owasp/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like many developers or IT professionals, you may have mixed feelings about these lists. I get it. On one hand, you know they&amp;rsquo;re important for keeping your applications and systems secure. On the other hand, they can be overwhelming, dry, and difficult to implement.
But what if I told you that security checklists don&amp;rsquo;t have to be that way? What if I showed you how to approach these lists in a whole new light, and make easy work of the items on them?</description></item><item><title>Keepin it SAST-y</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/06/devnexus-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/04/06/devnexus-2023/</guid><description>Conference speaker &amp;amp; organizer for the Open Source Security Foundation info booth at 2023&amp;rsquo;s largest Java Conference in North America.</description></item><item><title>5 Tools to Automate SBOM Creation</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/13/sbom-creation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/13/sbom-creation/</guid><description>If you search for “How to Automate SBOM Creation” you’ll find a huge number of results. As a software engineer, I personally get frustrated by those results almost instantly. Instead of telling me how to automate the creation of my SBOM, most of them spend half the article telling me why I should automate my SBOM creation.
I want to do this a bit differently by focusing just on tools you can actually use in your CI pipeline for free right now.</description></item><item><title>Open Source in Finance 101</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/08/os-in-finance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2023/02/08/os-in-finance/</guid><description>Grizz from FINOS interviews Eddie Knight and Colin Griffin on the fundamentals of Open Source in the Financial Services sector.</description></item><item><title>Interviewing Jon Gottfried &amp; Fiona Whittington</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/12/12/zbg-mlh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/12/12/zbg-mlh/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing Andres Vega</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/12/05/zbg-andres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/12/05/zbg-andres/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing Taylor Dolezal</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/28/zbg-taylor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/28/zbg-taylor/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing Vincent Danen</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/21/zbg-vincent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/21/zbg-vincent/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing Henry Quaye</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/14/zbg-henry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/14/zbg-henry/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Interviewing James McLeod</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/14/wgd-james/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/14/wgd-james/</guid><description/></item><item><title>What the OpenSSL Vulnerabilities Are…and Aren't</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/01/oss-contributor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/11/01/oss-contributor/</guid><description>In this article, we won’t be going into detail about how the vulnerability came to be or even how to patch it (in short: upgrade to the latest). Instead, we’ll be taking a quick look at what an exploit against these two new issues could be able to do- and compare it to two other common dependency exploits.</description></item><item><title>Stop the Low-Quality Contribution Plague</title><link>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/10/20/contribution-plague/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddieknight.dev/post/2022/10/20/contribution-plague/</guid><description>I was in a discussion thread with folks from Cloud Native Computing Foundation and Kubernetes today, and this phrase came up again.

I’ve seen a hundred false starts from recent grads and even people who have been working in tech for years.
